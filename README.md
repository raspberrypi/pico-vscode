# Raspberry Pi Pico Visual Studio Code extension

> **Note: The extension is currently under development.**

This is the official Visual Studio Code extension for Raspberry Pi Pico development. This extension equips you with a suite of tools designed to streamline your Pico projects using Visual Studio Code and the official [Pico SDK](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk).

For comprehensive setup instructions, refer to the [Getting Started guide](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/pico/getting-started-with-pico.pdf) PDF.

If you have any issues while installing, please check out the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section.

- Visual Studio Code v1.92.1 or later

### Raspberry Pi OS and Windows

No additional requirements are needed.

To meet the requirements for macOS, run the following command in Terminal to install necessary tools:
```zsh
xcode-select --install
```
This command installs all of the necessary tools, including but not limited to:
- **Git 2.28 or later** (ensure it's in your PATH)
- **Tar** (ensure it's in your PATH)

### Linux
- **Python 3.9 or later** (ensure itâ€™s in your PATH or set in settings)
- **Git 2.28 or later** (ensure itâ€™s in your PATH)
- **Tar** (ensure itâ€™s in your PATH)
- **\[Optional\]** gdb-multiarch for debugging (x86_64 only)
- **\[Optional\]** udev rules installed to use [OpenOCD](https://github.com/raspberrypi/openocd/blob/sdk-2.0.0/contrib/60-openocd.rules) and [picotool](https://github.com/raspberrypi/picotool/blob/master/udev/99-picotool.rules) without `sudo`, for debugging and loading
- For **\[Ubuntu 22.04\]**, install `libftdi1-2` and `libhidapi-hidraw0` packages to use OpenOCD

## Extension Settings

This extension provides the following settings:

* `raspberry-pi-pico.cmakePath`: Specify a custom path for CMake.
* `raspberry-pi-pico.python3Path`: Specify a custom path for Python 3 _(machine scoped)_.
* `raspberry-pi-pico.ninjaPath`: Specify a custom path for Ninja.
* `raspberry-pi-pico.gitPath`: Specify a custom path for Git.
* `raspberry-pi-pico.cmakeAutoConfigure`: Enable/Disable automatic CMake configuration when project is opened
* `raspberry-pi-pico.useCmakeTools`: Enable/Disable the CMake Tools Extension Integration (see below)
* `raspberry-pi-pico.githubToken`: Provide a GitHub personal access token (classic) with the `public_repo` scope. This token is used to check for available versions of the Pico SDK and other tools. Without it, the extension uses the unauthenticated GitHub API, which has a lower rate limit and may lead to restricted functionality if the limit is exceeded. The unauthenticated rate limit is per public IP address, so a token is more necessary if your IP is shared with many users.

## CMake Tools Extension Integration

For more complex projects, such as those with multiple executables or when the project name is defined as a variable, this extension can integrate with the CMake Tools extension to enhance CMake parsing. You can enable the CMake Tools Extension integration during project generation, using the checkbox at the bottom of the page. To enable it for an existing project, just re-import the project with the option selected. Alternatively, to manually enable it, adjust the following settings in your `settings.json`:

- `raspberry-pi-pico.cmakeAutoConfigure`: Set from `true` to `false`.
- `raspberry-pi-pico.useCmakeTools`: Set from `false` to `true`.

For optimal functionality, consider enabling:

- `cmake.configureOnEdit`: true
- `cmake.automaticReconfigure`: true
- `cmake.configureOnOpen`: true

When prompted, select the `Pico` kit in CMake Tools, and set your build and launch targets accordingly. Use CMake Tools for compilation, but continue using this extension for debugging, as CMake Tools debugging is not compatible with Pico.

## Rust Prerequisites

* **rustup** â€“ Installs and manages Rust. Get it from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs).
* A C compiler for your system:

  * **Linux**: `gcc`
  * **macOS**: `clang`
  * **Windows**: `MSVC`

## VS Code Profiles

If you work with multiple microcontroller toolchains, consider installing this extension into a [VS Code Profile](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/profiles) to avoid conflicts with other toolchains. Follow these steps:

1. Download the sample profile from [here](scripts/Pico.code-profile).
2. Open Command Palette with `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS) and select `Profiles: Import Profile`.
3. Import the downloaded file to install the extension in a dedicated Pico profile.
4. This setup helps isolate the Pico extension from other extensions, reducing the risk of conflicts.

## Troubleshooting

If you're having issues with installation, this is usually due to a download failure. To retry downloading everything, you can:
- Clear all setting for the extension (`Ctrl+Shift+P` -> `Preferences: Open Settings (UI)` -> Search for `raspberry-pi-pico` and reset everything to default)
- Uninstall the SDK (`Ctrl+Shift+P` -> `Raspberry Pi Pico: Uninstall Pico SDK`)
- Uninstall the extension, close & reopen VS Code, then reinstall the extension

Also make sure you've deleted any previous SDK installations (eg Pico setup for Windows, or a manual installation you've done), as those can conflict with this extension.

If you're still unable to get it working, then [file a bug report](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-vscode/issues/new?template=bug_report.md) and **fill out all the fields** so we can figure out the problem.

## Known Issues

- Custom Paths: Custom paths for Ninja, Python3, and Git are not stored in `CMakeLists.txt` like SDK and Toolchain paths. You need to build and configure projects through the extension to use these custom paths.

### GitHub API Rate Limit ("Error while retrieving SDK and toolchain versions")

If you encounter issues retrieving available Pico SDK versions, it may be due to GitHub API rate limits. To resolve this, create a personal access token (classic PAT) with the `public_repo` scope and set it in the global (User) extension settings to increase your rate limit.

## Build Instructions

For advanced users who want to build the extension `.vsix` file, follow these steps:

1. Install nodejs ([Instructions Windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-environment/javascript/nodejs-on-windows))
2. Update npm: `npm install -g npm`
3. Install VSCE globally: `npm install -g @vscode/vsce`
4. Run `npm ci` in the project directory to install dependencies.
5. Build the extension with: `vsce package`

This will generate a `.vsix` file, which you can install in VS Code using `code --install-extension path-to.vsix` or via the GUI: `Extensions > three dots > Install from VSIX`.
